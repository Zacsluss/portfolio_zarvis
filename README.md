# Hey, I'm Zac! 👋

**Welcome to my AI-powered portfolio** — where my resume meets GPT-4o and actually talks back.

I'm a **Lead CRM Systems Analyst** who's spent 7 years architecting Salesforce solutions for Fortune 500 companies across 22 countries. But instead of just listing that on a PDF, I built an AI assistant that knows my entire career and can chat with you about it.

**Meet ZARVIS** — my digital clone. Ask about my work, challenge it to explain complex enterprise architecture, or switch gears and have it run a D&D campaign. Yes, really.

## 💡 What Makes This Different

Most portfolios are static. Mine has a **GPT-4o-powered AI assistant** trained on my entire career.

**Try asking ZARVIS:**
- "What's Zac's Salesforce experience?"
- "Tell me about his biggest project"
- "Can you run a D&D campaign?" (seriously, try it)
- "Show me his technical skills"

It actually understands context. It can switch from enterprise consultant to dungeon master. It's not just keyword matching — it's a real conversation.

## ⚡ Why This Exists

**Traditional portfolios are boring.** PDFs get skimmed. Static sites get skipped.

I wanted to show what I can build while also making it easy for recruiters, hiring managers, and curious developers to learn about my work. So I built an AI that knows my entire career and can have real conversations.

It's a portfolio. It's a tech demo. It's open source. It's a conversation starter.

**And yes, it can be your dungeon master.** 🎲
